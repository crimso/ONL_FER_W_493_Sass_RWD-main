## Exercise 1 - done with the lecturer

> ### Setup
> Modify `package.json` so that the `source` variable points to:
> -  `01_Day_1/01_Sass_basics/01_First_steps_in_SCSS`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `package.json` you should stop Parcel (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`npm start`).**

* In `index.html` file add a `h1` with text, e.g. â€žHello, Sassy!" and open the file in the browser.
* Create a directory named `scss`, and create a `main.scss` file in it. The file should contain a header color and a background color for the entire page. The header should be readable.
* Load the `scss/main.scss` style sheet in `index.html`.
* Run parceljs with `npm start`.
* Check if an appropriate catalog with the `css` file was generated under root / dist of the repo.
* Refresh the page in the browser.
* Change the header color in the `scss` file and refresh the page once more.


## Exercise 2

> ### Setup
> Modify `package.json` so that the `source` variable points to:
> -  `01_Day_1/01_Sass_basics/03_Variables`
>
> **Remember that after each change in `package.json` you should stop Parcel (`CTRL+C`) and run it again (`npm start`).**

In the `scss/main.scss` file, you have a piece of code with sample page styling.

Your task is to move some of the values to variables in the `_variables.scss` file.

Look at the code, create appropriate variables, and use them in the code of the `main.scss` file.

For example, one of the variables may be **div size**, or their **color**.
